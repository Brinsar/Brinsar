## Introduction 
Hello! I am currently in the Webpage Development course. This is my final project for the course

## Description
A brief description of my project shows the colors I used to format the webpage which would be #c1d1e2, #6B80E3, #E3BD49, and white. Fonts that I chose are Abel and Gemunu Libre. I chose to make the contact form border to have a curved line instead of a box to add some spice to the website. I didn't want every box to be the same. test
